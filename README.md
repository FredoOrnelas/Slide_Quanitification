# Slide_Quanitification
This is an ongoing project inspired by the tedious work of quantifying images of stained slides, in hopes to alleviate the time it takes to achieve the accurate results

To begin: download the environment.yml file and install through conda, and download the scripts as you intend to use it.

- If you intend to help develop the script - download from the "still_developing" folder.
- If you intend to test the script on your own data - download from the "ready_to_test" folder.
- If you'd like a more refined script that has been tested on different data - download from the "ready_to_use" folder.

To run: Make sure to open the Stain_Quant_DAPI.py file in the yml environment.

Next Steps: There are currently scripts in progress to easily quantify the different stains with faster precision.
