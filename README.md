# Slide_Quanitification
This is an ongoing project inspired by the tedious work of quantifying images of stained slides, in hopes to alleviate the time it takes to achieve the accurate results

To begin: download the environment.yml file and install through conda, and download the Stain_Quant_DAPI.py file.

To run: Make sure to open the Stain_Quant_DAPI.py file in the yml environment

Next Steps: There are currently scripts in progress to easily quantify the different stains with faster precision.
